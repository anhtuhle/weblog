So, this is my nth attempt at blogging.

## What is this blog about?

This is a place for all of my notes and random thoughts. Sometimes I write about web development.

## Why Hugo?

I want my blog to be as simple and fast as possible. So _static site generator_ (SSG) is the best in the town. Now, which SSG to play with. I looked at several popular SSGs until I came across the title of [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/)'s homepage: "Hugo: The world's fastest framework for building websites". Ok, you got me, Hugo.

I also like [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/) but Hugo is more fascinating to me. Maybe next time, 11ty.

## The design of this blog

The design was mainly inspired by the simplicity of the no-nonsense blogging platform [bearblog.dev](https://bearblog.dev) of Herman and the _Jekyll_ theme [sidey](https://sidey-jekyll.netlify.app/).

At first, I tried to write as few CSS lines as possible. Just a simple mobile view for all devices. But the beauty of the sidey design was so tempting that I ended up writing CSS for the desktop view as well.

So, that's my story. If you having trouble reading this blog post, it's because English is not my native language and ChatGPT sucks at writing.
